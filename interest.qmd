In my spare time, I try to stay as well-rounded as I can.Â I've started reading more lately and I love it, but I fear nothing will ever top "Homegoing" by Yaa Gyasi for me. I'm currently reading "Things Fall Apart" by Chinua Achebe and "On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous" by Ocean Vuong.

I also love knitting and crocheting. I picked up crocheting at the beginning of this semester and hope to do it more in the coming years.

My favorite hobby of all is definitely baking. During the COVID-19 lockdown, I discovered that I loved making sweet treats almost as much as I liked eating them. I especially love cake decorating and appreciate the magic of a simple chocolate chip cookie. I plan on starting a business selling cakes next semester!
